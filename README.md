## Project Overview
This project automates the collection of weather data using Python, stores it in an AWS S3 bucket, and visualizes it through Amazon QuickSight. The workflow is as follows:
1. Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Upload the data to an S3 bucket.
3. Visualize the data using Amazon QuickSight.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
1. **Python 3.x** installed.
2. An **OpenWeatherMap API key**.
3. An **AWS account** with access to S3 and QuickSight.
4. **AWS CLI** configured with the necessary permissions.
5. Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup Instructions

### OpenWeatherMap API
1. Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Set the API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
The fetch_weather.py script uses the following endpoints:

Current Weather: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

5-Day Forecast: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast

### AWS S3 Bucket
    Create an S3 bucket:

    Name: weather-dashboard-bucket (or any unique name).

    Region: Choose a region close to your location.

    Permissions: Ensure the bucket is private and accessible only to authorized users.

    Set up a folder structure in the bucket:

    Copy
    s3://weather-dashboard-bucket/
    â”œâ”€â”€ raw-data/              # Raw JSON data from the API
    â”œâ”€â”€ processed-data/        # Processed data for visualization
    Update the upload_to_s3.py script with your bucket name and folder paths.

### Amazon QuickSight
    Create a new dataset in QuickSight:

    Connect to the S3 bucket (weather-dashboard-bucket).

    Use the processed-data/ folder as the data source.

    Create visualizations:

    Use line charts for temperature trends.

    Use bar charts for precipitation data.

    Use maps for location-based weather analysis.

    Publish the dashboard for sharing.

### Deployment
    The project can be deployed using AWS Lambda and EventBridge for automation.

    Steps to Deploy:
    Package the Python Scripts:

    Create a deployment package with the Python scripts and dependencies.

    Example:

    bash
    Copy
    pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./package
    cp fetch_weather.py upload_to_s3.py ./package
    cd package
    zip -r ../weather-dashboard.zip .
    Create an AWS Lambda Function:

    Upload the weather-dashboard.zip file as the deployment package.

    Set the runtime to Python 3.x.

    Add environment variables:

    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.

    S3_BUCKET_NAME: Your S3 bucket name.

    Set Up EventBridge Trigger:

    Create an EventBridge rule to trigger the Lambda function daily.

    Example cron expression for daily execution:

    Copy
    cron(0 12 * * ? *)  # Runs at 12:00 PM UTC every day
    Test the Deployment:

    Manually trigger the Lambda function to ensure it fetches data and uploads it to S3.

    Verify the data in QuickSight.
